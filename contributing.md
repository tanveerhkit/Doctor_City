### Installation

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
       npm install
   ```
3. **Database Setup:** 
Create a new database for Doctor City:

```bash
createdb doctorcity
```

Edit your configuration (typically a .env) to connect to your Postgres database:
```bash
DB_NAME=doctorcity

DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_pass
```
4. **Running the Application:**
Start the application in development:

```
### Branching Strategy

* Always branch out from `main`:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

* Use these prefixes for your branches:

| Type    | Prefix   |
| ------- | -------- |
| Feature | `feat/`  |
| Fix     | `fix/`   |
| Docs    | `docs/`  |
| Chore   | `chore/` |

### 📝 Commit Message Format

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for all commit messages.  
This ensures a consistent and meaningful commit history that’s easy to read and automate.

Example:
```bash
git commit -m "feat(component): add navbar component"
```

### 🔄 Pull Request Process

* Ensure your PR includes a **clear title and description**.  
* Link to any **relevant issues**.  
* Add **screenshots or demos** if applicable.  
* PRs should:
  - ✅ **Pass lint and formatting checks**  
  - 👀 **Be reviewed by at least one maintainer**  
  - 🔧 **Be rebased or merged cleanly with `main`**

Maintainers will review your PR and may request changes before approval. Once approved, your PR will be merged into the main branch.
